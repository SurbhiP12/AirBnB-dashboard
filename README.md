# AirBnB-dashboard
This is a beginner-level tableau visualization project on AirBnB.

This project aims to sharpen the basic visualization skills in tableau. You can download the dataset from Kaggle.

Some of the insights are as follows:

1.Avg price per bedroom

2.Distinct count of bedroom listings

3.No of reviews per room

4.Revenue per year

5.Price by Zipcode

With these,we are able to find some intersting results regarding different scenarios inside AirBnB.

Here's the tableau public link for my dashboard:
